# ActiveInferenceForager Documentation

This repository contains the documentation for the ActiveInferenceForager project. The project aims to explore the integration of Friston's Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference with Large Language Models (LLMs) for various AI applications.

## Overview

The ActiveInferenceForager project is an open-source initiative to develop AI systems that embody the principles of FEP and Active Inference. The project aims to explore the integration of these principles with Large Language Models (LLMs) to create AI systems that can learn and adapt to their environment.

## Documents

The documentation is organized into the following sections:

- [Development Plan](docs/development-plan.md): Outlines the integrated development plan for the project.
- [FEP and Active Inference QA](docs/active-inference-qa.md): Provides an overview of FEP and Active Inference concepts in QA form.
