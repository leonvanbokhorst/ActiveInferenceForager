# Integrated Development Plan: Free Energy Principle, Active Inference, and LLMs

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive, bottom-up approach for developing an AI assistant for higher education that integrates Free Energy Principle (FEP), Active Inference, and Large Language Models (LLMs). This approach ensures we maintain focus on the core theoretical foundations while leveraging the capabilities of modern language models.

## Core Principles

1. FEP-Driven Design: Each component embodies the principle of minimizing free energy (surprise).
2. Active Inference Implementation: The system actively explores and learns to improve its model of the user and environment.
3. LLM Enhancement: LLMs are used to augment capabilities, especially in natural language understanding and generation.
4. Incremental Development: Build the system step-by-step, thoroughly understanding each component.
5. Continuous Feedback: Regularly gather input from students and coworkers to refine the system.

## Learning Process

For each stage:

1. Study relevant FEP and Active Inference concepts
2. Explore how LLMs can enhance implementation of these concepts
3. Implement a basic version integrating FEP/Active Inference with LLM capabilities
4. Test the implementation in various educational scenarios
5. Document insights on how FEP/Active Inference principles manifest in LLM-enhanced systems
6. Demonstrate and discuss current capabilities with students and coworkers
7. Gather feedback on the integration of theoretical principles and practical performance
8. Refine the implementation based on feedback and theoretical insights

## Research Opportunities

- Investigate how FEP and Active Inference principles emerge in LLM-based systems
- Study the effectiveness of FEP-driven adaptive learning compared to traditional methods
